# Eryngium cuneifolium climate models

This repository contains example R code to support the manuscript "The implications of seasonal climatic effects for managing disturbance dependent populations under a changing climate", submitted to Journal of Ecology.

E. cuneifolium data and observed climatic data were provided by the Archbold Biological Station (https://archbold-station.org/html/datapub/data/dataovr.html). For more information on this dataset see:

The forecasted climatic data were provided by the Program for Risk Information on Climate Change (SOUSEI) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan carried out by the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). 
The authors are grateful to R.Mizuta, A.Kitoh and M.Hosaka for providing these data. For more information on the forecasted climate data see:
